## About Open-CMMS

Open-CMMS is a very badly found name for a simple data storage building oriented application. 
The purpose of this app is to allow people managing a lot of different building (city, state, etc.) to easly store their data in a relation database, to access them with ease and to make statistics out of these data. It also allows to access data with a power full rest API.

## Real purpose of the application

It's to learn Laravel and Angular with a simple, yet beautiful, web app. Futhermore it should also implement a swagger documentation and an OAuth ( or JWT if I fail OAuth )

## Why is it all in (bad written) English ?

Because i'm trying to improve my english, but don't worry my french is even worse :smile:
